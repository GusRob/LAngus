# LAngus

This project will be to create my own programming language, with its own set of syntax laws, a standard library and a compiler

Potential extensions may include developing a language specific ide or an ide package extension for this language to work with a text editor

The first step will involve researching the steps necessary to create a language and to format a plan on what the language will look like and how it will behave, as well as what steps i will need to take to create this
