This project will be to create my own programming language, with its own set of syntax laws, a standard library and a compiler

Potential extensions may include developing a language specific ide or an ide package extension for this language to work with a text editor

The first step will involve researching the steps necessary to create a language and to format a plan on what the language will look like and how it will behave, as well as what steps i will need to take to create this


Before starting, a list of basic ideas for what needs to be decided about this project :
  - compiled or interpreted? -
  - language used to write it? -


What are the stages in writing a program -> something happening? obviously the final state of the program would be machine code for the computer to interpret
    basic idea before research is:
    > program ->[lexer]-> token list ->[parser]-> abstract syntax tree ->[???]-> action tree ->[???]-> machine code/assembly
